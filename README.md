This project implements a deep learning solution to classify images of sportswear brands, specifically distinguishing between NIKE and ADIDAS products. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model learns from grayscale image data and accurately identifies brand-specific features to perform binary classification.

The solution includes image preprocessing, labeling using filename patterns, training a CNN model using Keras, and visualizing sample data.
